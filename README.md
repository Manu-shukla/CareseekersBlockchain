# CareseekersBlockchain
Problem - Medical Device/Sensor's/IOTs can share data but they need to be secure and accurate, Patient's can also share their paper data and EMRs data which also security storage and when any doctor or medico access these and uses or give back some advice, it should be recorded in very transparent way and most importantly a huge workforce of medicos centralised in cities hence healthcare is not easily accessible every where so this also need to be decentralised using technology. To engage doctors and medical students in solving patient problems and get academic incentives along with financial, gamification based credits can be used which can be exchanged in money. The gamification based credits will be a proof of experienced based learning. This is an important problem that need to be solved to make healthcare more affordable, accessible and most importantly transparent and in the longer run this will give a chance to continue as a private blockchain and generate huge amount of medical data for development of various data/AI based diagnostics, research, post market adverse effects of drug, and engaging medical community ( specially academics ). All these problem comes from project   User Driven Health Care http://www.udhc.co.in/ which i am working in since a year.

Solution - My solution covers all 3 categories - 1) blockchain consortium with minimum 2 parties ( Patient/Care Seeker and Doctors/Medicos/Caregiver), where it tracks medical data and any access, use, and advice on that. 2) IoT - Taking data from wearables , bionics, personal assistant devices, rehabilitative devices, diagnostic devices, etc. in realtime , using encryption,  verification it logging whenever accessed by a caregiver 3) Gamification - this is a private blockchain to make profit for the developing organization and gain money for verifying transactions which can be given to doctors/medicos in return of their experience credits as a financial benefit. All three are very important to include in such an app because without IOT data will be difficult, without gamification and benefits, getting doctors engaged in this virtual hospital kind of setup will be useful and there have to be many parties involved as a team in a patient centered healthcare system. here is a quick tour of concept that needs all the blockchain features discussed above to help masses for better health https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrJ0DfmRg8E
